       <!--  May expose internal representation by incorporating reference to mutable object 
             This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into the internal 
             representation of the object.  If instances are accessed by untrusted code, 
             and unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other 
             important properties, you will need to do something different. 
             Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.

       <!-- 
             This check has been removed as it is not consistent. It only occurs on 'known' 
             types (not your own classes), and only works on the first level. (ie. [], List, Set...)
             but not on the content of such classes. (ie. List in a Map).
             Non-OSGi code can only work on a deserialized version of those classes, meaning that 
             they use different instances.

             This check has been removed as it is not compatible with Hibernate which expects collection
             members to be defined as interfaces.
             From the Gluewine point of view, the classes do not need to be serializable, as they are 
             processed by XStream. But GWT needs the classes to be serializable for the communication
             between the servlets and the client.
